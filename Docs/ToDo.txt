Things to Do (not in priority)

1. Test ICM 20948 IMU with Raspberry Pi Pico
2. Test GPIO with LEDs 
3. Develop Sensor Fusion Algorithm (or Reference)
4. Look into LED Drivers
5. Start PCB Design


IDEA:

Business Card
Holds a Rp2040 Setup + 9Axis IMU + 8 LEDs
Connection + Power using USC type C
Can be used as: Compass + Magic 8 Ball Game + Dice + USB Orientation Sensor
Touch sensors as inputs for Reset + One User Input
