This Repo will host the files for my Business Card

# Things to Do (not in priority)

1. Test ICM 20948 IMU with Raspberry Pi Pico
2. Test GPIO with LEDs 
3. Develop Sensor Fusion Algorithm (or Reference)
4. Look into LED Drivers
5. Start PCB Design


# IDEA:

Business Card
<br>
Holds a Rp2040 Setup + 9Axis IMU + 8 LEDs
<br>
Connection + Power using USC type C
<br>
Can be used as: Compass + Magic 8 Ball Game + Dice + USB Orientation Sensor
<br>
Touch sensors as inputs for Reset + One User Input
<br><br>

Right now I have finished laying out schematice and initioal placement of the components on the PCB (no routing, didnt have time)

Here is a picture:
